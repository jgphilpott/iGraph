# Features

**The goal of Polyplot is to be the best data exploration software in the world!** This goal is achieved through a combination of innovative features, some of which are listed here.

### ~ Open Source

Polyplot has been built on GitHub from day one! The power of git and open source is that it enables the internet hive mind to collaborate on a project in a way that's impossible for a small closed group of developers. **You are encouraged to clone, fork and modify the code in any way you like!** If you find any bugs or have an idea for a new feature please [open an issue](https://github.com/jgphilpott/polyplot/issues).

### ~ 3D View

Polyplot raises the bar and takes data exploration to another dimension, literally! In addition to 2D plots and a map view Polyplot also offers a 3D visualization environment. Countries can be plotted as spheres in 3D space and animated through time. Under the hood Polyplots 3D graphics are powered by [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), so if you're familiar with that library you can easily modify the plot or add custom features.

### ~ Flexable UI

Polyplot has a uniquely lucid interface that creates a smoother experience for users and developers. Rather than having a fixed/static layout Polyplot expands the plotting area to fullscreen and pops out the controls/tools onto floating panels that can be placed anywhere and toggled on/off. For users this creates a more custom experience that makes better use of screen space. For developers it makes it easier to build new features in isolation without needing to worry about the overall architecture of the application.
