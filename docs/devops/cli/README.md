# Intro

The Polyplot CLI (Flint) was used in the early days of development for exploring database collections. Most of its functionality has been replaced by the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jgphilpott/polyplot/blob/master/docs/notes/README.md) service, however it does still work and **has the advantage of having root access to the Polyplot container.** You can for example explore the file system and start or end processes, which canâ€™t be done with the Jupyter Notebook because it runs as a separate docker container.
