# Intro

**Polyplot uses a document-oriented ([NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)) database called [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), all of Polyplots data is available in an API connected to this database.** The APIs primary routes correlate with collections in the database and the nested secondary routes correlate with a single document in that collection. You can also add a custom query, filter, sort and limit to the API route.
